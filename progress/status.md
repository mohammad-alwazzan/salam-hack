# Project Status
**Current Goal:** Voice integration migration to LiveKit-native tool state + RPC options flow

## 🏗️ System Health
- **Backend (backend/):** 🟢 HEALTHY — All routers, services, and agent tools implemented & seeded.
- **Frontend (frontend/):** 🟢 HEALTHY — All main pages, hooks, and components implemented.
- **Eden Bridge:** 🟢 HEALTHY — API client generated and consumed via TanStack Query hooks.

## 📍 Last Known Good State
- Backend running on :3001 with OpenAPI.
- Database seeded with Ahmed's demo data.
- Frontend implemented with Dashboard, Bills, Budget, Transactions, and Agent pages.
- Agent integrated with real-time financial data.
- Theme spec moved to light-first baseline and frontend no longer forces `.dark`.
- Dashboard section-link buttons updated for Base UI accessibility contract (`nativeButton={false}` with `Link` renders).
- Budget page now follows the new roomy analytics layout with monthly bars and spending breakdown chart.
- Voice UI now shows tool execution from `currentTool` state rather than message-derived detection.
- Frontend build passes (`bun run build`).
- Chat UI simplified: no listening/speaking state tracking, empty-state prompt suggestions now send messages directly.
- Budget chart axis/grid spacing fixed (no label/border overlap), and usage progress bar now reflects actual value correctly.
- Seed data refreshed with deterministic monthly expenses and explicit over-budget months for chart validation.
- Voice page rewired off `useAgentChat` to `useVoiceToolState` (LiveKit data channel).
- `show_options` RPC now drives `OptionsSelector` with a promise-based resolver.
- Voice tool UI migrated from `ToolResultRenderer` to `ToolCallBanner`.
- Frontend `.env.local` updated to new LiveKit credentials + `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_AGENT_NAME`.
- `/api/token?room=test` returns 200 using updated credentials.

## ✅ Voice Integration Checklist
- [x] Task 1 — frontend env updated
- [x] Task 2 — `use-voice-tool-state.ts` created
- [x] Task 3 — `ToolCallBanner.tsx` created
- [x] Task 4 — `voice/page.tsx` rewired (all sub-steps a–g)
- [x] Task 5 — `OptionsSelector` fully wired to `show_options` RPC
- [x] `bun run build` passes with zero errors
- [ ] Manual smoke test: open `/voice`, tap Start, speak "show me my bills" → `ToolCallBanner` appears → disappears when agent responds

## 🚧 Blockers / Next Steps
1. Run manual voice smoke test against live agent to verify `tool_start`/`tool_end` banner lifecycle.
2. Verify `show_options` end-to-end interaction from Python agent prompt.
3. Test the full flow of paying a bill via the UI.
